by Geun Jeon

Q1: When I tried the command “man .bashrc” and “.bash_profile”, the
shell gave comment back “No manual entry for .bashrc” and “No manual entry
for .bash_profile. However, when I tried “man bash”, the shell gave me
general commands manual for the bash. There was information about bash. I
tried command “? bashrc”  but it did not match any but I tried “?bash” and
search down to ~/.bashrc.

Q7: Yes

Q8: No, the permission was denied

Q9: I can use "chmod 7xx or 5xx". Example) chmod 700 hello.bash

Q10: First, vi gave message saying that the file is read only. Next, when I
modified and save and exit, it gave error message 'readonly' option is set
(add ! to override). I had to q! to force quit. Also, when I "ls" in
directory, there is a file named 'a'.

Q11: Following is output of each commands:

	gj65@tux2 lab01> ls *
	annoy     funny       itemList        lab1           UnitTestingPhase
	annoy.cc  hello.bash  itemList-2cols  TelecomTruths  vi_lab

	gj65@tux2 lab01> ls a*
	annoy  annoy.cc

	gj65@tux2 lab01> ls *m*
	itemList  itemList-2cols  TelecomTruths

	gj65@tux2 lab01> ls anno?
	annoy

	gj65@tux2 lab01> ls annoy?
	ls: cannot access 'annoy?': No such file or directory


Q12: At first, file does not save. I cannot find file with ls command. Next,
on second try, vi "a space" file was able to save and remove it with rm a\
space command
