gj65@tux2 ~> find . -type f -mtime -2 -print
./CS265/Git/lab2
./.viminfo

Q2: find . -type f -name "*.bash"

Q3: Following is the output:

gj65@tux2 lab02> find . -type f -name "*.bash"
./tmp/gotMe.bash

Q4: There are 2960 chars. I attached output below:

gj65@tux2 lab02> wc -m breadIsDangerous.txt
2960 breadIsDangerous.txt

Q5: There are 10 'the' in the file. I attached my input and result below:

gj65@tux2 lab02> grep -o 'the' breadIsDangerous.txt | wc -l
10

Q6: ispell -b gives back spelling errors. (Spell check)

Q7:'An extra line' comes out

Q8: Nothing came out

Q9:
First, grep finds word matching 'dough' from breadIsDangerous.txt as
following:
 
gj65@tux4 lab02> grep dough breadIsDangerous.txt
roven that as little as one pound of dough can be used to
5.   Bread is made from a substance called "dough." It has been
proven that as little as one pound of dough can be used to

Next, $? prints out most recent foreground pipeline exit status. So, in this
case, it prints out 0 as following:

gj65@tux4 lab02> echo $?
0

Next, there is no uniqueString so it prints out nothing. And next pipeline
count is 1.

gj65@tux4 lab02> grep uniqueString breadIsDangerous.txt
gj65@tux4 lab02> echo $?
1

Finally, since there is a file name noSuchFile, it messages user that it
does not exist. and next $? count is 2.

gj65@tux4 lab02> grep dough noSuchFile
grep: noSuchFile: No such file or directory
gj65@tux4 lab02> echo $?
2
