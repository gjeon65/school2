*Important*

I coded in Eclipse for this assignment for easy troubleshoot and tools as I code and it works perfectly on Eclipse.
However, when I transfered to PuTTy it throw errors. 


In my further research, PuTTy happens to compile differently then Eclipse
and some of the features aren't provided. 

Following is error command:

Note: infix2postfix.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
