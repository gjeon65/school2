The text file name is 'input.infix' and has to be in current directory.


I had issues with converting Eclipse file to here at PuTTy. Had to change
some of parts in order to work in PuTTy. The file seem to work fine at the
moment. But just in case, if you cannot compile, use javac -Xlint:unchecked
*.java'. 





*fixed*

I coded in Eclipse for this assignment for easy troubleshoot and tools as I code and it works perfectly on Eclipse.
However, when I transfered to PuTTy it throw errors. 


In my further research, PuTTy happens to compile differently then Eclipse
and some of the features aren't provided. 

Following is error command:

Note: infix2postfix.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
