Part 1: Debugging

Q1.1: Error occured. Following is the output:

Enter a string to search for => random
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Q1.2:
on inTable function, SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Q1.3:

a.In main function, scanf needed to be changed to 'scanf(%d,&n)'.

b.in main function, int and double type was misplaced. %d is for int %lf for
double. So, printf("Pi=%lf, n=%d\n", pi, n); is correct.

c. In while loop, it starts to increment before st[numLines] so it needs to
be increment after. So, in while loop, st[numLines] = strdup(buff); ++numLines; is correct.

d. In main function, scanf should be 'scanf("d",&n).

e.SIGSEGV, segmentation fault, on line 33. I could not figure out the
solution. But my best guess is swap function does not restore the pivot.

Q1.4: The compiler cannot find logical error.

Q1.5: Error, SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
